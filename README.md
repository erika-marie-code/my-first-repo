My first experience with Github

## Hello, welcome!
My name is **Erika Ortiz**, I am really excited to finally get immersed in a *new skill*.

I am currently a small business owner and decided I wanted to take my ***website building into my own hands***. I am in the wellness industry, and I want to build the technical skills that will support me in the long run in my career.

## Some of my offerings include:
- Reiki with Somatic Emotional Processing sessions
- Access Bars sessions
- Group Wellness sessions

I love anything related to psychology and holistic emotional wellness. Creating connections is my passion; I enjoy learning and working on becoming the best and most expressed version of myself.
